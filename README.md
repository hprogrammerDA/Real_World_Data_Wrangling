## Data Wrangling Project

### Date created 23.11.2023

### Description 
Project showcases a real world scenario of data wrangling. 
- Gathering Data
- Assessing Data
- Cleaning Data

Data is gathered from 7 different data sources in a combination of APIs, manual downloads and web scraping. 
The project is finalized by answering a research question with 2 visualizations. 

**Files used are:** 
* Data_Wrangling_Project HRD.pynb
* BrentSpotPrice Development 2000-2023.csv
* ECB Inflation 2000-2023.csv 
* ECB Rates 2000-2023.csv

### Potential future bugs
APIs can potentially change over time, providing new column names. 
The web-scraped data is prone to errors in the future when changes are made to the web page. 

### Credits
Credits to Udacity for project set-up.
